    - What are the most popular subreddits?
    - Which users are most active?
    - How many users are there?
    - How many subreddits are there?
    - What is the distribution of unique commentors per subreddit?
    - What is the distribution of number of comments a user has made to different subreddit?

- Based on the above EDA decide weather the data is sufficient for the similarity based recommender system without any cleaning 

- DCome up with a plan to trim the userbase and subreddits based on the EDA
