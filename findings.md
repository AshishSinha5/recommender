## 1.0-data-stats

- ~~The data contains comments which are automatically generated need to remove those~~ (not removing after analysis)
- The data contains comments from deleted users - need to remove those
- The comments with missing values of keys are deleted users
- Remove subreddits with less than 10 comments
- Remove users with few comments instead 
- 500k contiguous points are not sufficient for chronological split, need to sample data from different days for chronological split
